Changed to epoxy library for EGL, idk if this is the way to go TBH
Try fresh install of OS and then using the existing CMAKE file
changed all files to be GLES3.h from GLES2.h

Makefile includes for SDL:
find_package(SDL2 REQUIRED)
include_directories(${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS})
add_executable(VC6CV main_gl.cpp)
target_link_libraries(VC6CV ${SDL2_LIBRARIES})

${SDL2_LIBRARIES} in both libraries and gl_libraries
